    <description descriptionType="Abstract">The issue of supermarket chain power in wholesale markets has been around at least
since the 1930â€™s when A&amp;P surfaced as a nationwide chain with centralized buying (Adelman,
1959). Curiously those that complained the loudest were not firms that sold to supermarkets.
Small retailers, who were unable to wrest concessions from brand manufacturers or wholesalers
of fresh fruits and vegetables, alleged that large chain buyer power was driving them out of
business. Consequently the Robinson Patman Act (1936) was passed to monitor the exercise of
buyer power and its impact on smaller retailers as well as sellers. Enforcement has always been
a thorny exercise because cost justified large buyer discounts are not illegal.</description>
