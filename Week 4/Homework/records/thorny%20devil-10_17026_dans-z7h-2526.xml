    <description descriptionType="Other">How Nanzi tricked the Devil told by Rose Marie Sling (Nana Rosa), recorded on video for the Anansi Masters project in Curacao.

Subject: How Nanzi tricked the Devil

Description: Nanzi gets an impossible mission but his wit helps him to accomplish it.

Content: Nanzi does not want to give up his life of luxury, but his money is running out. Then the Devil strikes a deal with him. Nanzi can keep a flute that fulfills all his wishes on the condition that within fourteen days Nanzi knows for how long the Devil has been on earth. Nanzi enjoys the benefits of the flute and manages to keep it by tricking the Devil. 

About Anansi Masters: The Anansi Masters project is developed by Vista Far Reaching Visuals (Mr. Jean Hellwig) and partners. It is designed as a public digital platform at http://www.anansimasters.net and opened in 2007. At the website one can find information about the story character of Nanzi (or Anansi or Kweku Ananse), with English and Dutch subtitled video recordings of storytelling in several countries in different languages, educational modules about storytelling for use at schools and academies, and digital issues of the Anansi Masters Journal published since the beginning of the project. All storytelling videos are also published on Youtube. 
The stories of the Anansi tradition originate in Africa and were exported to other parts of the world through slave trade and migration. In Anansi Masters, the similarities and differences between the stories and storytellers, who tell in their own language, can be found. Anansi Masters initiates different activities all over the world where stories from this oral tradition can be found. The founder has the ambition to film as many stories from this tradition as possible in as many countries as possible. Anansi Masters collaborates with writers, theatre makers, filmmakers, researchers, schools and of course with many many storytellers.
