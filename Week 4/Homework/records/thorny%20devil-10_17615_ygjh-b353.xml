    <description descriptionType="Abstract">The purpose of this thesis will be to examine Gogol’s mature philosophy of language as it
is suggested by Dead Souls, taking into consideration both the novel’s thematics and its narrative
technique. I contend that Gogol uses the plot of the novel to model the way in which words are
capable of acting as conduits for poshlost’, and that, furthermore, certain aspects of the novel’s
narrative structure are motivated by and reflective of Gogol’s awareness that, as an author, he is
implicated in his novel’s condemnation of verbal language as a potential instrument of the Devil.</description>
