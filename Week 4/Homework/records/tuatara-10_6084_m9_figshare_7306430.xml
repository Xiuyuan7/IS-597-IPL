    <description descriptionType="Abstract">Individually identifying animals is key to ecological research. Natural
marks and patterns of animals that remain stable through time may be used to
identify individuals, either manually or with the aid of software. Here we
compare the performance of three body parts (chest, right side and right eye)
for individual identification of tuatara (&lt;i&gt;Sphenodon
punctatus&lt;/i&gt;) using three software packages (Wild-ID, I&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;S and
StripeSpotter). We also explored pattern stability over time for the chest and
right side, and whether the identification rate differed between life-history
stages (adults and juveniles) for this long-lived reptile. We used photos of
196 tuatara, including captive and free-roaming individuals. In an initial
analysis with a subset of individuals, chest and right side gave better
identification rates than the eye when analysed using Wild-ID (the
best-performing software). In a further analysis using all photos and Wild-ID,
the false rejection rate was lower for chest (0.6%) than right side (2.4%).
Although the effect of time on matching scores for chest (up to 3.5 y) and
right-side (up to 1.8 y) was significant, it was not large enough to reduce the
matching rate; furthermore, no difference in identification rate between adults
and juveniles was detected. Overall, chest was the best-performing body part
and Wild-ID the best-performing software. Thus, appropriate choice of body
pattern for analysis may significantly increase the matching rate, and, as
previously shown, software packages vary in performance.</description>
